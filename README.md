SMOS: A Linux-like Operating System
  - Operating System prototype coded in C, mimicking some of the Linux OS functionalities

  - Simulated all the structures involved in commands and processes execution (CPU, Kernel, Shell, Interpreter, 
    Shell Memory, RAM, Ready Queue, Process Control Block (PCB), Memory Manager, Backing Store)
  - Implemented important OS concepts including but not limited to: demand paging, script running functionalities, multi-process execution, efficient ressource         allocation, I/O functions, deadlock resolution and multi-threading
  - Used C modular programming techniques for functionality development
